Description
-----------

The Framed OLED plugin does allow a bit more fancy look and feel compared to P023 OLED.

The plugin allows to show several "pages" of information.
The number of pages depends on the number of set lines of text and the font size.

Switching between pages can be "instant" or "scrolling".
Please note that scrolling may need more resources of the ESP, which can have an effect on other active tasks of the node.

The plugin allows for a header and footer line, which may show some user selectable information.

Checkbox 'Wake display on receiving text' (default: on) allows to not wake up the display when a text is sent from a remote source, and Display Timeout is set.

All user defined texts may contain references to system variables or task values which will be interpreted when displayed on screen.

For example: ``[bme#T#D2.1] {D}C [bme#H]%``
